        <td>Increased CO2 levels drive global warming, leading to more intense weather, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification. This disrupts ecosystems, harms marine life, and impacts agriculture and human health. Adaptation and mitigation strategies, such as reducing emissions and enhancing resilience, are crucial to addressing these challenges. </td>

        <td>Increased oxygen (O2) levels can enhance the growth of some organisms, but it also risks exacerbating oxidative stress in plants and animals. High O2 levels might contribute to fires and affect respiratory processes. Generally, Earth's O2 levels are stable due to balanced biological and chemical cycles. </td>

        <td>Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a pollutant that can cause respiratory problems, irritate eyes, and contribute to acid rain. Acid rain harms ecosystems, soil, and water bodies. Reducing SO2 emissions involves controlling industrial processes and using cleaner energy sources to improve air quality and protect health. </td>

        <td>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a harmful pollutant that contributes to smog and acid rain. It can cause respiratory issues, aggravate asthma, and damage lung tissue. NO2 also affects vegetation and reduces air quality. Mitigating NO2 involves controlling emissions from vehicles and industrial sources. </td>

        <td>Ozone (O3) at ground level is a harmful air pollutant that can cause respiratory issues, aggravate asthma, and damage vegetation. It forms when pollutants like NO2 and volatile organic compounds react with sunlight. Ground-level ozone is a key component of smog. Reducing it involves controlling emissions from vehicles and industrial sources.</td>

        <td>*Methane (CH4)* is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. It has a much higher warming potential than CO2 but is present in smaller quantities. Methane is released from sources like livestock digestion, landfills, and fossil fuel extraction. Reducing methane involves managing waste, improving agricultural practices, and capturing emissions from energy production.</td>
